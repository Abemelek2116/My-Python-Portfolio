# 🎮 AI Tic-Tac-Toe (Minimax)

A console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can play against an **AI opponent** powered by the **Minimax algorithm**.  
This project demonstrates **algorithmic thinking, recursion, and strategic game AI** in Python.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

In this project, I implemented a **Tic-Tac-Toe game** with two modes:
- **Human vs Human** (two players)  
- **Human vs AI** (single player with intelligent moves)  

The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** to always make the optimal move, ensuring that it never loses.  
This project helped me practice **recursion, board evaluation, and decision-making algorithms** in Python.

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Human vs AI gameplay  
- ✅ Human vs Human gameplay (optional)  
- ✅ AI uses Minimax algorithm for optimal strategy  
- ✅ Console-based board display  
- ✅ Beginner-friendly and modular code  
- ✅ Fully documented with clear function structure

## 🧩 How It Works

1. The game board is a **3x3 grid**.  
2. Players take turns placing **X** or **O** on the board.  
3. After each move, the game checks for:
   - Winner (row, column, or diagonal)  
   - Tie (board full with no winner)  
4. If playing against AI:
   - AI calculates the **best move** using **Minimax**  
   - Human makes their move  
   - Board updates and displays after each turn  
5. The game continues until there is a winner or a tie.

## 🖥️ Example Gameplay

🎮 Welcome to AI Tic-Tac-Toe!
You are 'X' and AI is 'O'.

| |
| |

| |

Enter the row (0,1,2): 0
Enter the column (0,1,2): 0

X | |
| |

| |

🤖 AI is making a move...
X | |
| O |

| |

...
🎉 Congratulations! You won!
