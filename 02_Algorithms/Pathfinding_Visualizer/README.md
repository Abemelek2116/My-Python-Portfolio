# 📍 Pathfinding Visualizer (A* Algorithm)

A **Python-based Pathfinding Visualizer** that demonstrates the **A* algorithm** in action.  
Users can interactively create a grid, set start and end points, add obstacles, and visualize the algorithm finding the shortest path.

This project showcases **algorithmic thinking, problem-solving, and GUI development** in Python.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The **Pathfinding Visualizer** allows users to:

- Click to set a **start node**, **end node**, and **obstacles** on a grid
- Watch the **A* algorithm** explore the grid
- See the **shortest path** highlighted from start to end
- Gain an intuitive understanding of how pathfinding algorithms work

The project was designed to be **interactive, beginner-friendly**, and visually demonstrative of AI search algorithms.

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Interactive **grid-based GUI** using `tkinter`  
- ✅ Click to place **start, end, and obstacles**  
- ✅ **A* pathfinding algorithm** with Manhattan distance heuristic  
- ✅ Visualization of **open nodes, closed nodes, and final path**  
- ✅ Beginner-friendly, modular, and well-commented code  
- ✅ Fully portfolio-ready

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **User interaction:**  
   - Click to set the **start node** (green)  
   - Click to set the **end node** (red)  
   - Click to toggle **obstacles** (black)  

2. **Algorithm execution:**  
   - Open nodes are shown in **blue**  
   - Closed nodes (already evaluated) are **grey**  
   - The shortest path is highlighted in **yellow**

3. **Visualization:**  
   - The grid updates in real-time to show the algorithm’s decision-making process
