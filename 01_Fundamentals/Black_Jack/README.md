# 🃏 Blackjack — Python Console Game

## 🎯 Overview

This project is a simple yet fully functional Blackjack game built in Python.
It follows the traditional rules of Blackjack, where the player competes against a computer dealer.
The game logic demonstrates clean code design, control flow, functions, and user interaction — making it a strong portfolio project for showcasing Python fundamentals.

## ⚙️ Features

✅ Randomized deck using Python’s random module

✅ Automatic Ace value handling (11 → 1 when necessary)

✅ Dealer (computer) plays according to standard Blackjack rules

✅ Dynamic win/loss logic with clear results

✅ Supports multiple game rounds

✅ Clean and commented code — easy to read and maintain

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to structure a Python program using functions and loops

- Handling conditional logic for complex rules

- Using randomization to simulate real-world behavior

- Writing modular, readable, and reusable code

- Managing user input and game state in a console-based program

## 🕹️ How to Play

Run the program in your Python environment.

You start with two cards; the computer (dealer) also gets two cards.

Decide whether to:

Type `y` to draw another card (Hit)

Type `n` to pass (Stand)

The dealer automatically plays after your turn.

The winner is decided based on the highest score without exceeding 21.

## 🧩 Rules Recap

Cards 2–10 are worth their face value.

Jack, Queen, and King are worth 10.

Ace can be 11 or 1, whichever is better for the hand.

A “Blackjack” (Ace + 10) automatically wins the round.

## 🚀 How to Run
- Option 1 — Using Replit (Online)



Click `Run` to start the game.

- Option 2 — On Your Local Machine

Make sure you have `Python 3.10+` installed.

Save the project as `blackjack.py`.

Run the game:
```yaml
python blackjack.py
```

## 🧾 Example Output
```output
Do you want to play a game of Blackjack? Type `y` or `n` : y
Your cards: [10, 7], current score: 17
Computer's first card: 6
Type `y` to get another card, type `n` to pass: n

Your final hand: [10, 7], final score: 17
Computer's final hand: [6, 10, 7], final score: 23
Opponent went over. You win 😁
```
## 🧰 Technologies Used
