# 🧠 Python Fundamentals Projects

Welcome to my **Python Fundamentals Section** — a collection of beginner-to-intermediate level projects.
Each project reflects my progress in mastering Python’s core principles — from simple data handling to structured logic and problem-solving.  
Every line of code was written and refined to build a solid foundation in Python programming.
