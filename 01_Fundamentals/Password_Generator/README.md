# 🔐 Password Generator 


A beginner-friendly Python project that generates secure, randomized passwords using letters, numbers, and symbols.  
This project is based on **Day 5** of Angela Yu’s *100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp*.

---

## 🧠 Features

- Generates passwords with customizable counts of:
  - ✅ Letters  
  - ✅ Symbols  
  - ✅ Numbers  
- Randomizes order for improved security  
- Clean, well-commented code — beginner-friendly and reusable  
- Follows best practices for maintainability and clarity  

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. The user specifies how many **letters**, **symbols**, and **numbers** to include.
2. The program randomly selects characters from predefined lists.
3. The final password is shuffled for randomness and displayed to the user.
