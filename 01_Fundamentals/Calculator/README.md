🧮 Python Calculator
🎯 Overview

This project is a simple, interactive command-line calculator built in Python.
It performs basic arithmetic operations and allows users to continue calculations using previous results, demonstrating function design, loops, recursion, and clean programming structure.

⚙️ Features

✅ Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
✅ Handles division by zero gracefully
✅ Allows continuous chained calculations
✅ Built with modular and reusable functions
✅ Follows Python’s best practices and PEP 8 standards
✅ Works on any platform — no dependencies required

🧠 What I Learned

How to design modular programs using functions and dictionaries

Implementing loops and conditional logic for continuous interaction

Error handling (e.g., divide by zero, invalid operator)

Writing clean, professional, and maintainable Python code

Structuring a CLI (Command-Line Interface) project for GitHub portfolios

🕹️ How to Use
1️⃣ Run the Program

Run the calculator in your terminal:
```
python calculator.py
```
2️⃣ Follow the Prompts

Enter the first number

Choose an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)

Enter the next number

Decide whether to continue with the result or start over

💡 Example:
```yaml
Welcome to the Python Calculator!

Enter the first number: 10
Available operations:
+
-
*
/
Pick an operation: *
Enter the next number: 5

Result: 10 * 5 = 50

Type 'y' to continue calculating with 50, or 'n' to start a new calculation: y
Pick an operation: -
Enter the next number: 30

Result: 50 - 30 = 20
```
