# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (Python)

- A simple yet engaging **Number Guessing Game** built in Python.  
- The computer randomly selects a number between **1 and 100**, and your task is to guess it in as few attempts as possible.  
- The game offers two difficulty levels — **Easy (10 attempts)** and **Hard (5 attempts)**.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

It demonstrates:
- Core Python logic and conditionals
- Function usage and scope
- Handling user input
- Using loops and control flow
- Basic debugging and game design principles

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Two difficulty levels — *Easy* and *Hard*  
✅ Instant feedback (“Too high” / “Too low”)  
✅ Input validation for non-numeric guesses  
✅ Clean and well-structured code  
✅ Beginner-friendly and fully documented  

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. The program picks a random number between **1 and 100**.  
2. You choose a difficulty level:
   - **Easy** → 10 guesses  
   - **Hard** → 5 guesses  
3. You enter your guesses.  
4. The program gives feedback each time:  
   - "Too high" or "Too low"  
   - If correct → “🎉 You got it!”  
5. If you run out of attempts → game over!

## 🖥️ Example Run

🎯 NUMBER GUESSING GAME 🎯
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Choose a difficulty. Type 'easy' or 'hard': easy
You have 10 attempts remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 50
Too high.
Guess again.
You have 9 attempts remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 25
Too low.
Guess again.
You have 8 attempts remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 33
🎉 You got it! The answer was 33.
